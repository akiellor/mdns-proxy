This is a proof of concept using mDNS to configure a Load Balancer / Reverse Proxy.

The proof on concept is in two parts, the rack proxy and a script to spin up new 'hello_world' app servers.

Start the proxy with:
  $ rackup proxy.ru

Start the app servers with:
  $ ./hello_world.rb <port>


After hitting the proxy a number of times you will notice the content of the request body will change depending on which app server handles the request.
